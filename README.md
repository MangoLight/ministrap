# Ministrap
Ministrap, a small front-end framework inspired from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for faster and easier web development, created by [Nicolas Thomas](http://www.nicolasthomas.fr) for [MangoLight](http://www.mangolight.com) Web agency.

## Why ?
- Only the best from Bootstrap, in more simple (and faster)
- Works well on all major browsers and devices
- Fast: Only some lines of CSS & Javascript, and 2 fonts.

## Demo
Ministrap is used on the project's website: [http://www.mangolight.com/labs/ministrap](http://www.mangolight.com/labs/ministrap)

It is also used on the following sites :
- http://www.mangolight.com
- http://www.sni2a.fr
- http://www.camille-beaute-extensions.com
- http://www.st-lunaire-impas.fr

Feel free to contact me if you use Ministrap and would like to add your site in that list.
